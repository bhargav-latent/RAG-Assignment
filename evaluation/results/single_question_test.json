In practice, this is approximated by a neural network.\n*   **\\(\\eta \\ge 0\\)** is a parameter that controls the level of stochasticity (randomness) during the generation process.\n*   **\\(\\mathrm{d}w_t\\)** represents a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion) in reverse time.\n\nBy solving this equation from \\(t=1\\) (pure noise) to \\(t=0\\) (data), the model can generate samples from the target data distribution \\(p(x)\\).\n\nSources:\n[Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation, page 2 (Eq. 2)]",
  "correctness_score": 5,
  "correctness_explanation": "The agent's answer provides the exact formula specified in the ground truth, correctly defines all parameters (eta, f_t, g_t, score function, and Wiener process), and explains the derivation of the coefficients. It is completely correct and detailed.",
  "groundedness_score": 5,
  "groundedness_explanation": "The agent's answer is highly grounded. It provides a specific and complex mathematical formula (the reverse-time SDE) and attributes it directly to a specific location in the source documents ([Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation, page 2 (Eq. 2)]). All variables (x_t, f_t, g_t, score function, \u03b7, dw_t) are clearly defined in a way that is consistent with technical literature on diffusion models. The citation is explicit and the information provided is verifiable given the source.",
